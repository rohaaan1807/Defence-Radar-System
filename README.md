Components Required are: Arduino UNO , Ultrasonic Distance Measuring sensor, Servo Motor,Buzzer, Battery , Cardboard Base, Jumper Wires.

Process -

Connect the Trigger Pin and Echo Pin to the digital Pins 10 and 11 of the Arduino respectively. 
Connect the Servo to digital Pin 12 of the Arduino UNO.
Setup the Trigger and Echo Pin as output and Input respectively.
In the loop Function, create the loop for rotating servo motor for specified degrees(15 to 165 Degrees in this case.
Create a function for calculating the distance of object from US distance	measuring Sensor.
Now Specify the conditions for time and buzzer.

ALL THE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS CAN BE SEEN IN THE CODE.
